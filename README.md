# My Professional Portfolio
This project encompasses html and css code to create a fully functional portfolio that can be provided to prospective employers. In this project are examples of flex properties, navigation links both internal to the page and to external websites. Included are a short "about me" section regarding myself, examples of work (including some placeholders for things to come), and updated information by which someone can contact me.
